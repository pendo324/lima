  # Get the faas-cli from one of following sources:
  # package manager:
  brew install faas-cli
  #
  # script:
  curl -sLS https://cli.openfaas.com | sh

  # You can now log into your gateway:
  ------
  export OPENFAAS_URL=http://localhost:8080
  limactl shell faasd sudo cat /var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password | faas-cli login -u admin --password-stdin
  ------
